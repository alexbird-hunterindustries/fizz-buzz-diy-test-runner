# Code Exercise: FizzBuzz

To improve my mental model around unit testing, I'll solve FizzBuzz

### FizzBuzz

- Convert a number to a string
- Most numbers are just `.toString()`ed (2 => '2')
- If the number is a multiple of 3, instead return 'Fizz'
- If the number is a multiple of 5, instead return 'Buzz'
- If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, instead return 'FizzBuzz'

### Learning Plan

1. I'll solve FizzBuzz using `console.log()` like I'm used to
2. I'll transform my `console.log()` to Jest syntax
3. I'll adjust my mental model as I go
