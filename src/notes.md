# What is a test framework?

## What's good about our current approach?

- we can define a set of examples for our code
- it tells us if the code matches the examples
- separates the test plumbing from the code examples
- supports parameterized tests
    - (which is helpful for simple functions that map input to output)

## What's missing from our current approach?
