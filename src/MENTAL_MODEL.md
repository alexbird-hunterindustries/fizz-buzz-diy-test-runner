## At Work

We use Jest for unit testing

## At Home

`console.log()` is all I need to check my work

## My Mental Model

I know the how and why of `console.log()` to check my work

I know the syntax for Jest testing because we use it at work

Jest feels like magic.

`console.log()` feels good enough for me.

## Goal

I'd like to make the connection between my familiar `console.log()` technique and the
familiar Jest syntax.

I'd like Jest to feel less magic and more familiar.
