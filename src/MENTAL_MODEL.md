## My bare minimum test runner

- Makes it easy to write a list of examples (expected and actual)
- No test infra cluttering up my examples
- Runs the examples, telling me if any fail
- Gives an overall "pass"/"fail" so I know at a glance if we're all good

### A test runner organizes examples

So that makes sense why I don't feel the need for it on little hobby projects.

At work we deal with bigger systems which need more examples which need better organizing

### A test runner summarizes failures

I want to know if everything is OK

If it's not all OK, I want to know what part is not OK

### Familiar syntax

I don't know if there are better syntaxes for this, but I used a popular one and it went
fine
