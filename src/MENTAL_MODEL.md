## `console.log()`

- It's helpful to write the expected value so I can compare expected with actual
- `console.log()` was good enough for me to practice TDD for FizzBuzz
- With a unit test runner it says "pass" or "fail", but here I had to check for myself

## What would I like from a test runner

- Easy to write expected and actual
- Tells me if it passes or fails
    - for each example
    - for the whole thing

## Find the bug

I have to check every example to see if it matches.

I'd like each example to say "pass" or "fail"
