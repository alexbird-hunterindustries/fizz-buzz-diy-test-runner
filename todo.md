# TODO

- interactive rebase to reformat the demo code -- there are formatting changes partway
  through that distract
- export a copy of the slides and put them in git before the demo code (so when we're
  halfway through gitpresenter we don't lose slides)
- formatting error on slide 50
- record a practice presentation for timing (and to get some feedback)
