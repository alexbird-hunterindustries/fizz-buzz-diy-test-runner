## Intro Question

### For coders

Which of the following statements best fits your current approach to dev
tooling?

1. Somebody else sets up the development environment and chooses the tools. I
   write code in the provided environment.
2. I choose or build the tools I need to do my job. When they don't suit my
   needs, I change them.

I hope after today, you will be more comfortable operating in the second mode.

### For coaches/teachers

What techniques do you use to de-mystify tools or techniques that your pupils
treat as a "magical black box". When folks are looking for cheat sheets but you
want to give them a rich mental model instead, how do you do it?

Today I will be showing a teaching technique I use that starts with "if we
didn't have tool X or other off the shelf alternatives, what would we do?". You
may find it helpful, or you may have advice for me for other ways I can transfer
my mental model about a tool to pupils.
