# What Even Is A Test Framework?

## The "Taboo Test" Learning Algorithm

# Taboo

Give clues to get your team to say "Dolphin", but you can't say
any of these words.

# The "Taboo Test"

Can you explain the thing without saying the thing?

# What Even Is a Test Framework?

Pretend with me for a moment that you do not know what is a test framework.

If you genuinely don't know, even better.

# Sidebar: Why Are We Pretending

- Software dev is a **learning profession**.
- When you're a **faster learner**, you're **more senior**
- This talk is **an exercise in learning**
- So even testing experts: pretend with me that you're learning about test frameworks
    - Because I'm sure you still have to learn *something* in your career

# Survey the field

Suppose you've joined a team, and they say

> We use xUnit for unit testing

So you do a web search

# Exercise

Discovering the essence of the Test Framework

We're going to be coding FizzBuzz together, but we'll be creating a test framework as we go.

By the end, we'll have solved FizzBuzz and we'll have about ~100 lines of code for our test framework

We're going to be coding FizzBuzz together, but we'll be creating a test framework as we go.

By the end, we'll have solved FizzBuzz and we'll have about ~100 lines of code for our test framework

We'll use Node.js with no dependencies and aim for Jest/Jasmine syntax
