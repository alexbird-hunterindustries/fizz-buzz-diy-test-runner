# Observations

## General Observations

- For basic TDD in a single file, you can get by with very simple test tooling
  - We have shown that if your languange supports equality comparison and print
    statements, you can write a minimalist test "framework"

## What do we look for in a test runner?

1. A way to compare actual and expected, and print the results
2. (sometimes, depending on what we're testing) parameterized testing to run
   many similar tests
